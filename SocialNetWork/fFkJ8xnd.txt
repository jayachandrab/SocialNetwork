Task - Social Graph

This task is designed to give us an idea of how you approach software development problems. 
We will look at the structure of any database tables you might create, as well as the structure
of your code and whether or not the solution you create is extensible. We are looking at how 
efficient your algorithms are as well as which existing tools you chose to use and how you 
integrate them.

Problem Description

The purpose of this task is to create a method of examining a social network.
You are given data (data.json) representing a group of people, in the form of a
social graph. Each person listed has one or more connections within the group.

Come up with a data structure to store and query the information found in the 
JSON file.

You should then create a public interface in the language of your choice which 
allows for three basic operations to be executed for a certain person:

Direct friends: Return those people who are directly connected to the chosen person.

Friends of friends: Return those who are two steps away, but not directly connected
to the chosen person.

Suggested friends: Return people in the group who know 2 or more direct friends of 
the chosen person, but are not directly connected to her.

Your API can be exposed as public functions, a REST-endpoint, a command line
interface, whatever fits the choice of your technology stack best.

Requirements

Use object oriented design
Write unit and/or integration tests to verify your solution works
Provide information on how to setup, test and use your solution
Spend max. 3h. Complete within a week (two weeks in special circumstances).
Suggestions

Use a VCS
Use appropriate package managers when include 3rd party libraries
We hope you have fun working on this mini-project and are looking forward to 
reading your code!
